Week 7 Assignment: Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (week_7_assignment.ipynb) for an assignment focused on data analysis and visualization. The project uses the Iris dataset to:

Load and explore the dataset using pandas.
Perform basic data analysis (e.g., compute statistics, group data).
Create visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot) using matplotlib.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn



Installation/Setup

Install Anaconda (recommended for easy setup):

cd week-7


Launch Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook

This will open a browser window. Navigate to week_7_assignment.ipynb and open it.

Usage

Open the week_7_assignment.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter.
The notebook includes:
Data loading and exploration steps.
Basic data analysis (statistics and groupings).
Four visualizations with explanations.
Key findings from the analysis.

Key Findings

Setosa species has the smallest average sepal length, while Virginica has the largest.
Petal length varies significantly across species, with Setosa having the smallest petals.
The scatter plot shows a clear separation between species based on sepal length and petal length.
